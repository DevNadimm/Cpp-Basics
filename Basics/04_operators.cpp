    There are 3 types of operations in C:
    1. **Arithmetic Operations**: These operations perform mathematical calculations.
       - Example: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
       - Used to perform basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

    2. **Relational Operations**: These operations compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
       - Example: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
       - Used to compare variables and expressions for equality or to check the relational conditions (greater than, less than, etc.).

    3. **Logical Operations**: These operations are used to perform logical (Boolean) operations, typically used in conditional statements.
       - Example: `&&`, `||`, `!`
       - Used to combine multiple conditions. For example, checking if two conditions are true (`&&`), if at least one condition is true (`||`), or negating a condition (`!`).
